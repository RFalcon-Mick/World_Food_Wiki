# Pizza

## Introduction
Pizza is a leavened flatbread topped and baked at high heat. While many cultures bake topped flatbreads, **the modern, globally recognized pizza** emerged in Naples, Italy, then diversified through migration, industrialization, and local taste adaptation into a wide spectrum of regional styles (Helstosky, 2008; Capatti & Montanari, 2003).

---

## Place of Origin
- **Region:** Naples, Campania, Italy  
- **Context:** A dense port city whose poor and working classes relied on inexpensive, portable foods. Wheat supply, wood-fired ovens, and New World tomatoes converged to create a uniquely Neapolitan product (Capatti & Montanari, 2003).

---

## Time of Emergence
- **Late 18th century:** Recognizable tomato-topped, leavened flatbreads sold by street vendors; early pizzerias consolidated in the 19th century (Helstosky, 2008).  
- **1830:** Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba opens as a sit-down pizzeria, often cited as the world’s first (Hughes, 2009; Food Republic, 2025).  
- **1889 (traditional account):** *Margherita* pie popularized in national symbolism narratives; historians note the tale’s myth-making elements, but the tri-color combination (tomato–mozzarella–basil) became canonical (Helstosky, 2008).

---

## Origins
Antique flatbreads (Roman *focaccia*, Greek *plakous*, Levantine breads) prefigure pizza; **the decisive innovation** was adopting **tomato** in southern Italy during the 18th century and baking a **high-hydration, hand-stretched, quickly fired** disc in wood ovens (Albala, 2011; Helstosky, 2008).

---

## Historical Development (Concise Timeline)
- **1738 → 1830:** Port’Alba evolves from vendor oven (1738) to pizzeria (1830) in Naples (Hughes, 2009).  
- **19th c.:** Pizza entrenched as working-class staple; early flavor sets: oil/garlic, anchovy, later tomato & mozzarella (Helstosky, 2008).  
- **1900–1930s (US):** Italian migration seeds American pizzerias; *Lombardi’s* (NYC) licensed in **1905**; coal and later gas deck ovens shape a drier, larger pie (Lombardi’s; Asimov, 1998).  
- **1940s–1960s:** New regional US styles crystallize (Chicago deep-dish 1943; Detroit 1946; New Haven’s coal-oven *apizza* matures; St. Louis Provel culture) (Food & Wine, 2021; Eater Detroit, 2025; Bon Appétit, 2019, 2022).  
- **1950s–1970s:** Post-WWII demand, frozen pizza commercialization, and national chains (Pizza Hut 1958; Domino’s 1960) accelerate diffusion (Helstosky, 2008).  
- **1962 (Canada):** “Hawaiian” pizza with pineapple invented in Ontario (Panopoulos) (Atlas Obscura, 2015; Time, 2017).  
- **Late 20th–21st c.:** Global hybridization (Japan’s corn–mayo, Brazil’s *Catupiry*, Sweden’s banana–curry; Korea’s sweet-potato mousse; India’s paneer toppings).  
- **2010 & 2017:** EU **TSG** registration for *Pizza Napoletana* (2010) and **UNESCO** recognition of the **Art of Neapolitan Pizzaiuolo** (2017) anchor heritage and production norms (EU, 2010; UNESCO, 2017).

---

## Regulatory & Heritage Status
- **UNESCO (2017):** *Art of Neapolitan Pizzaiuolo* inscribed as Intangible Cultural Heritage—recognizes craft, social rituals, and transmission (UNESCO, 2017a; 2017b).  
- **EU TSG (2010–):** “*Pizza Napoletana (TSG)*” entered in the Traditional Speciality Guaranteed register; fixes ingredients and processing ranges (EUR-Lex, 2010).  
- **AVPN “Disciplinare”:** Non-governmental, detailed rulebook for *Verace Pizza Napoletana*; hand stretch; specific flour; 430–480 °C wood-fire; **60–90 s** bake; defined dough parameters and topping standards (AVPN, 2024; AVPN, n.d.).

---

## Ingredients (Core, Neapolitan Canon)
- **Flour:** Italian wheat, typically Tipo “00”.  
- **Water, salt, yeast:** Long, cool fermentation (often ≥8–24 h) for extensibility and flavor.  
- **Tomatoes:** San Marzano or comparable plum varieties.  
- **Cheese:** *Fior di latte* or *Mozzarella di Bufala Campana*.  
- **Olive oil & basil:** Classic condiment pair (AVPN, 2024; Albala, 2011).

---

## Cooking Methods
### Neapolitan Method (Vera Pizza Napoletana)
1. **Mix & ferment** a lean dough (no fats/sugars), bulk + ball fermentation for extensibility.  
2. **Hand stretch** to ~30–35 cm, keeping a puffy rim (*cornicione*).  
3. **Top lightly** (crushed tomato, fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil).  
4. **Bake** in a wood-fired dome at **430–480 °C** for **60–90 s**; aim for tender, moist center with leopard-spot char (AVPN, 2024; AVPN, n.d.).

### Other Common Methods
- **Deck ovens (NY/US styles):** 290–370 °C, longer bakes, drier, crisper undersides.  
- **Pan styles (Detroit, Sicilian):** Oiled steel/aluminum pans; caramelized edges; cheese-to-edge technique (Food & Wine, 2021; Eater Detroit, 2025).  
- **Fried doughs:** *Pizza fritta* (Naples) and global analogues (Tasting Table, 2025).

- **Nordics:**  
  - **Sweden:** Banana–curry pizza entrenched since late 20th c. (Smithsonian, 2024).  
  - **Finland:** “Berlusconi” pizza (smoked reindeer, red onions) famously trolled Italian taste in competitions (press lore).  
- **Germany/Benelux:** Doner-pizza hybrids and heavy vegetable/meat combos via Turkish diaspora.  
- **Eastern & Baltic Europe:** Mayonnaise-leaning salads and corn prevalent; chain adaptations.

### Middle East & North Africa (pizza & “pizza-like” kin)
- **Turkey:** *Pide* and *lahmacun* are distinct flatbreads sometimes dubbed “Turkish pizza” in the West; meanwhile, international pizza chains localize with sucuk and peppers.  
- **Levant:** Pizza coexists with **manakish** culture; za’atar/cheese flavors cross-pollinate.

### Sub-Saharan Africa
- **South Africa:** Local toppings include boerewors, chutneys, peri-peri chicken; strong takeaway culture centered in malls and petrol plazas.  
- **North & Horn:** Italian colonial legacies leave pizzerias in Eritrea/Ethiopia; harissa and preserved lemon show up in Maghrebi riffs.

---

## Technical Notes (Dough & Bake)
- **Dough science:** Hydration 58–70% typical (style-dependent); long fermentation increases extensibility and flavor while moderating sugar for high-heat bakes (Albala, 2011; AVPN, 2024).  
- **Cheese behavior:** Low-moisture mozzarella provides browning and oil release in deck ovens; fresh mozzarella suits fast bakes.  
- **Pan geometry:** Steel/aluminum pans (Detroit, Sicilian) trap oil to shallow-fry the crumb bottom; blue-steel pans historically linked to auto industry trays (Allrecipes, 2024; Eater Detroit, 2025).
