# Wonton

## Introduction
**Wonton** is a class of Chinese dumplings consisting of a thin wheat-flour wrapper filled with seasoned mince (commonly pork or pork–shrimp), cooked primarily by **boiling or poaching** in broth, and sometimes **deep-fried**.  
Compared with **jiaozi** (crescent dumplings), wonton wrappers are typically thinner and square/diamond-shaped, and the finished dumpling is smaller, with characteristic folds (e.g., *ingot*, *goldfish*, or *nurse-cap* forms). Wonton is served in clear soups, with noodles, dressed in spicy sauces, or fried as snacks, reflecting its adaptability across regions and eras.

## Place of Origin
- **Region**: The North China heartland is widely considered the cradle of stuffed boiled doughs. Wonton subsequently developed prominent regional identities in **Lingnan (Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau)**, **Fujian**, **Sichuan**, **Jiangnan**, **Taiwan**, and through the Chinese diaspora across **Southeast Asia** and beyond.  
- **Geographic–Cultural Context**: Wheat cultivation in northern China provided the technological and material basis for **laminated doughs and dumpling wrappers**, while bustling urban markets (especially from the **Song** period onward) enabled street-vended cooked foods to flourish, including wonton and its variants.

---

## Time of Emergence
- **Attested Emergence**: Antiquity to early imperial China, with the culinary form recognizable by the **Han–Six Dynasties** period and widely disseminated by the **Tang** and **Song** eras.  
By the medieval period, “wonton” denoted a specific class of **boiled stuffed dumplings**, distinct in name and often in form from related items such as **jiaozi** and **bianshi**, though the boundaries between these categories remained fluid in everyday practice.

---

## Origins
The term **huntun (餛飩/馄饨)** appears in early Chinese literature with cosmological meanings (“primordial chaos”), later transferring to the culinary sphere as a name for **stuffed dough boiled in broth**.  
Culinary wontons likely evolved from a broader repertoire of **boiled wheat-dough preparations** in the north. As urban foodways matured, thin wrappers and finely minced fillings distinguished wontons from thicker-skinned, larger dumplings. Over time, **regional seasonings** (e.g., fermented condiments in the southwest, dried seafood in the southeast) and **broth styles** (light bone broths in the north; dried-flounder–anchored stocks in Cantonese cookery) produced enduring local identities.

---

## Historical Development
- **Han–Six Dynasties (2nd c. BCE–6th c. CE)**: Emergence of boiled stuffed doughs as recognizable dishes in elite and common diets; terms related to *huntun* appear in texts and lexica, indicating the dish’s early cultural foothold.  
- **Tang (618–907)**: Growth of metropolitan cuisines in **Chang’an** and other cities fosters professional cooking households and street vendors; wonton becomes part of urban snack culture served in light broths with aromatics.  
- **Song (960–1279)**: Urbanization and night markets expand the repertoire: specialized stalls sell **wonton in broth**, often alongside noodles and other small eats; refined folding methods and thinner wrappers take hold.  
- **Yuan–Ming–Qing (1271–1912)**: Marked **regional differentiation**.  
  - **Cantonese–Hong Kong**: Formation of shrimp–pork wontons served with alkaline egg noodles in a clear, umami-forward stock (dried flounder, shrimp roes, Jinhua ham).  
  - **Fujian**: Development of **bian rou** (扁肉/扁肉燕) with **ultra-thin wrappers beaten from seasoned pork paste**, achieving a translucent, delicate skin.  
  - **Sichuan**: **Chao Shou** (抄手) emerges—wontons in **red chili oil** or **garlic–sesame sauce**, also served in clear soups.  
  - **Jiangnan–Shanghai**: **Sanxian** (three-delicacy) fillings with pork, shrimp, and seasonal greens; both **large “big wonton”** and **small wonton** styles are documented.  
- **19th–20th Centuries (Diaspora and Modernization)**:  
  - **Southeast Asia**: **Wonton noodles** (wonton mee) and **fried wontons** enter hawker repertoires in **Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand**, often with local sauces (kecap manis, chili).  
  - **Globalization**: In the **Americas** and **Europe**, “wonton soup” and **crispy wonton** become Chinese-restaurant standards; commercial **factory-made wrappers** and frozen wontons proliferate.  
- **21st Century**: Continued globalization, convenience products, and culinary heritage initiatives. Artisanal shops emphasize **stock craft**, **hand-beaten fillings**, and **regionally specific folds**, while culinary schools and media document distinct local lineages.

## Ingredients
### Wrappers
- **Wheat flour**, **water**, and often **egg** (especially in Cantonese noodle–wonton systems); salt may be added.  
- Wrapper thickness varies: **ultra-thin** for Cantonese and Fujian styles; **slightly thicker** in some northern traditions.

### Fillings (Common)
- **Pork** (minced), often with **shrimp**; aromatics: **scallion**, **ginger**, **white pepper**; seasonings: **soy sauce**, **sesame oil**, **rice wine**; optional **mushroom**, **bok choy/greens**, **napa cabbage**.  
- Regional ingredients: **dried shrimp/flatfish** (Cantonese broth), **Sichuan pepper/chili oil** (Sichuan *Chao Shou*), **lean-and-gelatin mix** for springy textures, **meat-paste wrapper** (Fujian).

## Cooking Method
### Traditional Preparation
1. **Dough & Wrappers**  
   Knead flour and water (optionally egg) to a smooth dough; rest; roll and cut into **squares/diamonds** (or prepare purchased wrappers).  
2. **Filling**  
   Mince pork (and shrimp) finely; season; **stir in one direction** to develop tack for cohesive texture.  
3. **Folding**  
   Place a small mound of filling; fold into **ingot**, **triangle-to-ingot**, **goldfish**, or **nurse-cap** shapes; ensure a tight seal.  
4. **Cooking**  
   **Boil/poach** in gently simmering water or broth until wontons float and turn translucent; avoid overcooking to preserve wrapper integrity.  
5. **Service**  
   Ladle into **clear broth** (often chicken–pork bone stock) with scallion, white pepper, a few drops of sesame oil; or dress in **chili–garlic–sesame** sauce (southwest); or **deep-fry** and serve with vinegar–chili dip.

### Major Regional Styles
- **Cantonese Wonton Noodles**: Shrimp–pork wontons with **thin alkaline egg noodles** in a clear, seafood-enhanced stock; hallmark toppings include **yellow chives** and **dried flounder aromatics**.  
- **Northern Clear-Broth Wontons**: Light pork fillings; broth often clarified, seasoned simply with scallion, white pepper, and **egg ribbons** or **seaweed**.  
- **Sichuan “Chao Shou”**: Wontons in **red chili oil** with **garlic**, **sesame paste**, and **vinegar**; also available in clear soups.  
- **Fujian “Bian Rou”**: Wrapper produced from **pounded pork paste**, yielding a paper-thin, elastic skin; served in delicate broths.  
- **Shanghai–Jiangnan “Sanxian”**: Mixed fillings with **pork–shrimp–greens**; both **large** and **small** wontons, commonly paired with **light broths** or **simple sauces**.  
- **Overseas Adaptations**: **Wonton mee** (dry or soup) in Southeast Asia; **deep-fried wontons** and **wonton strips** in Western Chinese restaurants.

## Cultural Significance
Wonton exemplifies the **technical subtlety** of Chinese dough craft—fine wrappers, elastic fillings, and precisely controlled **heat and hydration**.  
It functions as everyday comfort food, festive fare, and a **culinary signifier** of regional identity (e.g., Cantonese wonton noodles in Hong Kong, *Chao Shou* in Chengdu).  
Contemporary documentation by culinary schools, media, and local heritage bodies underscores **lineage-based techniques** (stock making, wrapper fabrication, canonical folds), ensuring continuity while accommodating global tastes.
