# Dongpo Pork

## Introduction
**Dongpo Pork** is a **square-cut, skin-on pork belly** braise characterized by a mahogany glaze and a melt-in-the-mouth—but still sliceable—texture. The dish is named for **Su Dongpo** (Su Shi), the Song-dynasty poet–official whose culinary reputation and writings helped sanctify leisurely gastronomy as an extension of literati culture (Anderson, 1988; Chen, 2019). While related to the broader family of **red-braised pork** (*hongshao rou*), Dongpo Pork denotes a **particular cut geometry, restrained aromatics, wine-forward braising medium, and presentation in tidy blocks** (Dunlop, 2016; Lin & Lin, 1969).

---

## Place of Origin
- **Core loci claimed:**  
  - **Huangzhou** (present-day Huanggang, Hubei), where Su was exiled and wrote the famous “Ode to Pork”; local narratives argue the dish’s earliest cooking practice crystallized there (Hubei Gov., 2016).  
  - **Hangzhou** (Zhejiang), where Su later served as prefect; here the dish was **popularized and canonized** within Jiangnan banquet culture and remains a city signature (Hangzhou Gov., 2018; China Daily, 2023).  
- **Broader context:** Jiangnan’s **rice–wine economy**, access to high-quality soy sauces, and refined banquet aesthetics provided the ecological niche for Dongpo Pork’s rise (Anderson, 1988; Dunlop, 2016).

---

## Time of Emergence
- **Late 11th century (Song):** Su’s exile (1080s) provides the literary–cultural seedbed; poems and anecdotes praise pork’s frugal savor and **patient heat** (Su Shi’s “Ode to Pork” passages paraphrased in Chen, 2019).  
- **Ming–Qing consolidation:** Red-braising techniques are widely documented; **Qing literati compilations** (e.g., Yuan Mei’s *Suiyuan Shidan*) canonize elite banquet tastes and validate braising protocols that align with present-day Dongpo practice (Chen, 2019; Anderson, 1988).  
- **Modern era:** Restaurants in Hangzhou (e.g., Louwailou) fix the **square-cut, lacquered** aesthetic and broadcast it nationally; regional cuisines adapt naming and seasoning to local palates (Louwailou; China Daily, 2023).

## Origins
Multiple legends attribute invention to Su Dongpo—**overseeing dike works at West Lake**, **losing track of a simmer while playing chess**, or **rewarding laborers with pork stewed in wine**. Historiographically, these are **etiological tales**: they **bind technique to personhood**, but documentary proof is thin. What is well-attested is the **Song literati’s culinary commentary** and **Jiangnan’s maturing braise culture**, which together birthed a **distinct, wine-forward pork belly braise** later named for Su (Anderson, 1988; Chen, 2019; FCDC Taiwan, n.d.).

---

## Historical Development (Timeline)
- **1080s (Song):** Su’s Huangzhou exile; pork praised for frugality and patience—**long, slow simmering** yields virtue and savor (Chen, 2019).  
- **12th–14th c.:** Southern Song & Yuan sources document wine, soy, and sugar braises; **red-cooking** consolidates as a core method.  
- **18th c. (Qing):** Yuan Mei’s *Suiyuan Shidan* codifies literati banquet aesthetics and **balanced seasoning**; Dongpo-style braises align with its precepts (Chen, 2019; Anderson, 1988).  
- **19th–20th c.:** **Hangzhou restaurants** standardize the **square-cut Dongpo block** and **clay-pot service**; the dish travels via chefs and state banquets.  
- **21st c.:** Municipal standards and tourism promotion in Zhejiang/Hangzhou specify **cut size, wine usage, skin-down braising, and glaze**; diaspora kitchens extend serving formats (e.g., **mantou** sandwiches) (Zhejiang Prov. Portal, 2024; Hangzhou Gov., 2018/2023).

---

## Ingredients
**Canonical Jiangnan set (Hangzhou model):**
- **Pork belly** (skin-on; even fat–lean layers; common block sizes: ~4–6 cm).  
- **Shaoxing wine** (dominant liquid; sometimes majority of the braising medium).  
- **Soy sauces** (light for salt/umami; dark primarily for color).  
- **Rock sugar** (for sheen and controlled sweetness).  
- **Aromatics**: **Ginger** (essential), **scallion** (used as an aromatic and physical trivet).  
- **Optional** (regional): star anise, cassia, pepper—generally muted compared with other red-braises.

## Cooking Method
### Standard Hangzhou Procedure
1. **Blanch** pork belly to remove scum; rinse and **square-cut** (strings may be tied to maintain geometry).  
2. **(Optional) Light fry/caramelize** surface to fix shape and deepen color.  
3. **Pack over scallion “rafts”** (to prevent scorching), add ginger; **flood with Shaoxing wine**, supplement with soy sauces and rock sugar.  
4. **Braise skin-down** at a **gentle simmer** (or low oven) until the **collagen gelatinizes** and the **skin becomes custardy**; reduce to a **lacquered glaze**.  
5. **Plate in single blocks** with **glossy sauce**; garnish minimally (often just blanched greens).  
**Targets:** tender but sliceable core; translucent skin; balanced savor–sweet; wine aroma.

### Texture & Heat Science (practical notes)
- Collagen solubilization occurs with **long residence** around **80–90 °C**; keeping a **sub-boiling** simmer preserves geometry and creates **custard-like skin**.  
- **Wine-heavy media** and **low spice** prevent muddy flavors; sugar **polishes** proteins for gloss.  
- **Skin-down orientation** promotes **even heat** and **fat rendering** into the sauce rather than drying the lean.

## Regional & Stylistic Variants

### A. Zhejiang & Jiangsu (Jiangnan heartland)
- **Hangzhou Classic:** Strict square blocks, **wine-dominant braise**, low-spice profile; frequently associated with heritage restaurants such as **Louwailou**; municipal guidance specifies **skin-on belly, scallion/ginger trivet, Shaoxing wine, controlled sweetness** (Hangzhou Gov., 2018/2023; Zhejiang Prov. Portal, 2024).  
- **Shaoxing Variant:** Emphasizes **huangjiu** terroir; sometimes even higher wine ratio with slightly lighter color; banquet presentation in single-serve clay pots.  
- **Ningbo/Wenzhou Coastal:** Slightly salt-forward to pair with seafood menus; sugar restrained; some kitchens slip in a touch of aged soy for color.  
- **Suzhou–Wuxi (Huaiyang reach):** **Sweeter profile** (rock sugar generous), ultra-glossy reduction; in Wuxi-leaning houses the dish may overlap with **Wuxi-style red braises** while still presented as Dongpo blocks (Dunlop, 2016; China Daily, 2023).  
- **Yangzhou (Huaiyang):** Lighter seasoning and knife-neat geometry; emphasis on **purity of pork flavor** with delicate wine bouquet.

### B. Hubei & Sichuan (Su’s life geography)
- **Huangzhou (Hubei) Lineage:** Local heritage framing ties the dish explicitly to **Su’s exile**; narratives stress **slow fire**, **wine**, and **patient heat** as the “spirit” of Dongpo (Hubei Gov., 2016).  
- **Sichuan (Meishan/Chengdu):** Some kitchens incorporate **a whisper of spice** (star anise, cassia) and marginally deeper soy color; still **less aromatically complex** than typical Sichuan red-braises to preserve Dongpo identity.  
- **Emei/Ya’an:** Mountain eateries sometimes finish with **rice-wine reductions** and serve with **steamed buns** for soaking sauce.

### C. Shanghai & Surroundings
- **Shanghai banquet houses:** Present **perfectly squared blocks**, **deep glaze**, and **clean cross-sections**; sweetness calibrated between Hangzhou and Wuxi; Shaoxing wine remains central.  
- **Nanjing/Zhenjiang:** Soy–vinegar kitchens occasionally introduce **Zhenjiang vinegar** in minute amounts to sharpen the finish (still atypical in strict Hangzhou canon).

### D. Northern & Inland Adaptations
- **Beijing/Tianjin:** Hotel classics keep square cuts but may use **lighter wine ratios**; occasionally thicker gravies to accommodate northern staple pairings (mantou).  
- **Shaanxi/Henan:** Heavier soy notes; star anise appears more frequently; presentation may be **shared slabs** instead of individual blocks.

### E. Southern China & Hakka Sphere
- **Guangdong/Hong Kong:** High-end Cantonese restaurants render **refined, minimal-spice** versions; some menus cross-label **Dongpo** and **扣肉 (kou rou)** though techniques differ (Dongpo keeps braise & geometry; **kou rou** relies on steaming with preserved greens).  
- **Fujian:** **Red yeast rice wine (hongzao)** shows up in some Fuzhou-leaning houses, creating a ruby hue distinct from standard Dongpo caramel tones.

### F. Taiwan, Southeast Asia & Overseas Chinese
- **Taiwan:** Banquet versions hew to Jiangnan style but are widely **served with mantou**; retail products (e.g., **Dongpo pork buns**) and convenience formats are common; spice minimal, wine balanced (Taiwan retail/press; diaspora cookery).  
- **Singapore/Malaysia:** **Nanyang** kitchens sometimes sweeten with **gula melaka** and serve with **plain mantou**; spice additions remain restrained to protect the Dongpo profile.  
- **Diaspora (US, EU, ANZ):** Restaurants frequently label **square-cut red-braises** as **Dongpo Pork** when geometry and wine ratio match, even if minor aromatics drift toward local taste.
