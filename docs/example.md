## Origins
The idea of flatbreads topped with various ingredients existed in many cultures (ancient Greeks, Persians, Middle Eastern societies).  
However, the Neapolitan pizza crystallized into its modern form with the use of **tomatoes**—a New World ingredient initially mistrusted in Europe—and the rise of **street food culture** in Naples.

## Historical Development

- **19th century**: Pizza became a staple among the working-class population of Naples.  
- **1889**: Chef Raffaele Esposito created the *Pizza Margherita* with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil to represent the Italian flag.  
- **20th century**: Italian immigrants brought pizza to the United States, where it evolved into new forms (e.g., New York style, Chicago deep dish).  
- **21st century**: Globalized variations emerged (Japanese mayonnaise pizza, Brazilian dessert pizza), while UNESCO recognized the **Art of Neapolitan Pizzaiuolo** as intangible cultural heritage in 2017.

### Traditional Neapolitan Pizza
1. **Dough Preparation**  
   - Mix flour, water, yeast, and salt.  
   - Allow fermentation for 8–24 hours.  
2. **Shaping**  
   - Dough stretched by hand, not rolled, to preserve air pockets.  
3. **Topping**  
   - Tomato sauce spread lightly, followed by mozzarella, olive oil, and basil.  
4. **Baking**  
   - Baked in a wood-fired oven at **450–480°C** for about **60–90 seconds**, producing a soft crust with characteristic leopard-spot charring.

- **Chicago Deep Dish**: Thick crust with inverted layering (cheese → toppings → tomato sauce).  
- **Modern Adaptations**: Gluten-free doughs, vegan cheese, experimental toppings.
