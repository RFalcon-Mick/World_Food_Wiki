# ðŸ“š Citation Guide Â· World Food Wiki

This document explains how to cite and reference sources in dish entries.  
While references and citations are **optional**, they are strongly encouraged for historical accuracy.

---

## 1. Purpose of Citations
- Provide **credibility** to historical claims.  
- Allow readers to **trace information** back to original sources.  
- Distinguish between **documented history** and **oral/community knowledge**.

---

## 2. Citations in Text
- Use **Author + Year** format:  
  Example: *(Helstosky, 2008)*  
- Multiple authors: *(Capatti & Montanari, 2003)*  
- Web sources: *(UNESCO, 2017)*

---

## 3. References Section
If you include a **References** section, list sources in the following format:

### Books
```
Author Lastname, Firstname. (Year). *Book Title*. Publisher.
```
Example:  
Helstosky, C. (2008). *Pizza: A Global History*. Reaktion Books.

### Articles / Papers
```
Author Lastname, Firstname. (Year). "Article Title." Journal Name, Volume(Issue), pages.
```
Example:  
Smith, J. (2015). "The Evolution of Street Food in Italy." *Food History Journal*, 12(3), 45â€“67.

### Websites / Archives
```
Organization or Author. (Year). "Title or Description." Website Name. URL (Accessed YYYY-MM-DD).
```
Example:  
UNESCO. (2017). "The art of Neapolitan 'Pizzaiuolo'." Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. https://ich.unesco.org (Accessed 2025-10-04).

### Oral Traditions / Community Knowledge
If the source is oral history or community tradition, specify clearly:
```
Community name, Location. Interview/Fieldwork, Year.
```
Example:  
Local Pizzaiuoli Association, Naples. Fieldwork notes, 2023.

## 4. When References Are Missing
- It is acceptable to omit references if no documented sources are available.  
- Use phrasing such as *"According to oral traditionâ€¦"*, *"Local accounts suggestâ€¦"*.  
- Do not present unverifiable claims as historical fact.
