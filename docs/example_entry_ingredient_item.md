# Garlic

## Introduction
Garlic (*Allium sativum*) is a bulbous flowering plant in the onion genus. It is one of the most widely used flavoring agents in world cuisine and has held a place of significance in medicine, ritual, and culture for thousands of years.

## Place of Origin
Garlic is believed to have originated in **Central Asia**, with early domestication in regions corresponding to modern-day **Iran and Turkmenistan**.

## Time of Emergence
Cultivation records trace back to at least **4000 BCE**, with mentions in ancient Sumerian and Egyptian texts.

## Origins
Wild species of *Allium* were likely foraged before cultivation began. Garlic was domesticated for both flavor and medicinal properties, valued for its pungent oils and preservative qualities.

## Historical Development
- **Ancient Egypt**: Garlic was given to workers building the pyramids to promote strength and endurance.  
- **Classical Greece & Rome**: Consumed by soldiers and athletes for vitality.  
- **Middle Ages**: Used widely in European cuisine and folk medicine.  
- **Modern Era**: A staple ingredient across Asia, Europe, and the Americas; research highlights antimicrobial and cardiovascular benefits.

## Culinary Uses
Garlic is used in countless preparations:
- **Raw**: Adds sharpness in salads and sauces.  
- **Cooked**: Roasting, sautéing, or frying mellows flavor and adds sweetness.  
- **Preserved**: Pickling, drying, and fermenting (e.g., black garlic) are common techniques.  

It serves as a base flavor in dishes ranging from Italian pasta sauces to Chinese stir-fries.

## Cultural Significance
Garlic has been associated with spiritual protection (against evil spirits in European folklore) and is symbolically important in various ritual practices, including Indian and East Asian traditions.

## Nutritional Information
